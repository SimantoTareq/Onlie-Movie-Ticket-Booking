<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>Ticket Booking Website project is based on movie tickets. We have made this project for a renowned movie theater. Where people do not need to stand on serials to purchase tickets. They need to just go and collect tickets and enjoy the show.</p>
<p>Our mission is to connect the authority of movie theaters with the customers. Customers or clients will visit the website and will know about the now showing movies and upcoming movies. Then they will decide on their choice and book the tickets and it will be confirmed by the admins.</p>
<p>This project is a website built with the latest technologies, promising the customers to be associated with the community.</p>
<p><strong>FEATURES</strong></p>
<ul>

<li> Seats can be booked as per movies</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>TECHNOLOGY</strong></p>
<p>We decided to go with latest technologies for developing this website in order to give users a better experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Frontend</em></p>
<p>For the front end we used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This enables cross platform development which allows the website to be compatible with the clients. It also gives a more premium user interface and smoother experience.</p>
<p><em>Backend</em></p>
<p>For the back end we have used PHP, mysql. This allowed us to make a database for the system and collect the data from the clients and store it in the database. We used PHP to connect the front end system with the database.</p>
<p><em>Database</em></p>
<p>We have used mysql to store data and provides high performance, availability and automatic scaling.</p>
<p><em>Booking method</em></p>
<p>User need to select the movie, date and time to book a ticket. He/She needs to provide some additional information like name phone no etc. The booking will be confirmed by the admins.</p>
<p><em>Additional technologies</em></p>
<p>Used javascript to validate the form information before submission. And also used google map API to present the exact location of the theater to the customers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Monetization</strong></p>
<p>As the web application is targeting customers of movie theaters, we will try to sell the movie tickets to the customers and receive a percentage per sell.</p>
<p>Movie theater organization will give a fund to develop a website for them to express their service on online.</p>
<p>For future development they will keep providing funds to keep developing or maintain security of their website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>In summary, the project is a basic movie ticket booking website. In this project we completed most of the functionalities proposed. Though basic features of the website work fine, one major problem is, we could not implement a feature where a single user can order multiple ticket at a time. Without this feature the website is incomplete. In future, I plan to implement this missing functionality, come up with better solution for the implementation and make the app even better. </p>
